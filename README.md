- Developed an open-world game using OpenGL and GLFW, optimizing pipeline with custom GLSL shaders for real-time ray
tracing and adaptive sampling to improve rendering time by 20%

- Engineered high-performance particle system utilizing GPU instancing and deferred shading to render over 10,000 particles
simultaneously without sacrificing frame rate

- Integrated a multi-resolution rendering technique using OpenGLâ€™s LOD management and mipmapping with texture atlases,
reducing GPU memory bandwidth usage by 30%
